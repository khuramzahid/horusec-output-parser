# Horusec Output Parser

## About The Project

This tool can be used to group the output of the Horusec SAST tool.  

### Prerequisites

Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Mozilla Firefox.

As a preliminary step, in the terminal, navigate to this directory. Later, we will run the horusec start command mentioning the path of the code for analysis as follows:
`horusec start -p ./path/to/code`.

## Getting Started

1. Simply clone the repository on your machine and run the HTML file in the root directory
2. You will be asked to select a file that contains the Horusec output text
3. After selecting the file, the parser will produce its output in the console tab of the browser
